            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <p><strong>Mortgage Database Project</strong><br>
              As a database developer, I successfully completed a comprehensive banking mortgage and loan system project. This involved designing and implementing an ETL solution to consolidate loan applications from various sources into a unified Loan Application Database. The process included validating data for required fields and formats, and developing a notification system for loan officers to address any errors. I created a robust data warehouse to store both approved and rejected loans, ensuring scalability for future growth. Additionally, I developed comprehensive reports to provide business intelligence on an hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly basis. The project was executed using Agile methodology, dividing the work into releases, sprints, and user stories to ensure timely and high-quality deliverables. This structured approach enabled the bank to streamline their loan processing and enhance decision-making capabilities.

              Major Activities of the Project:
              ETL Solution Development:
              Designed and implemented ETL processes to handle data from online forms, email/fax, and third-party platforms.
              Consolidated data into the Loan Application Database.
              Data Validation:
              Implemented validation rules to check for required fields and correct formats.
              Developed a notification system for loan officers to address data errors.
              Error Handling and Resubmission:
              Created workflows for loan officers to review and correct application errors.
              Implemented a resubmission process for corrected applications.
              Daily Application Review:
              Developed a user interface for loan officers to review applications daily.
              Integrated functionalities for approving and rejecting applications.
              Data Warehousing:
              Designed and built a scalable data warehouse to store approved and rejected loans.
              Ensured the data warehouse supports future growth.
              Reporting:
              Developed reports to provide business intelligence on various time scales.
              Ensured reports meet the needs of different stakeholders.
              Agile Methodology Implementation:
              Divided the project into releases, sprints, and user stories..</p>
            <p><strong>Online Sales Project</strong><br>
              This project focuses on managing online and retail sales transactions by leveraging two key data processing structures: OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) for live data and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) for historical data. The project begins with the creation of a Business Requirement Document (BRD) that outlines the business needs and objectives. Based on the BRD, the team receives daily CSV files from various sources, including customer, production, category, and sales data. To ensure data integrity and avoid duplication, the existing data is first truncated before loading the new data into a staging table. The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, facilitated by SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services), extracts the data from the staging table, transforms it as needed, and loads it into the master table. This OLTP process ensures real-time data handling and transaction processing. Once the data is cleaned and transactions are completed, the OLAP process begins. The first three tables (customer, production, and category) populate the master table in the data warehouse as dimensional tables, while the sales table, which serves as the fact table, is moved to the data warehouse for analysis and reporting. This historical data is managed using Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) to maintain both current and historical records. Finally, the data is visualized using Power BI, providing insightful reports and dashboards for business analysis and decision-making.

              In this project, my role involved overseeing the entire ETL process. I was responsible for truncating existing data to prevent duplication, loading new data into the staging table, and using SSIS to extract, transform, and load the data into the master table. I ensured that the OLTP process ran smoothly, handling real-time data and transactions efficiently. Additionally, I managed the transition to the OLAP process, ensuring that historical data was accurately moved to the data warehouse and maintained using Slowly Changing Dimensions. I also utilized Power BI to create visual reports and dashboards, enabling effective business analysis and decision-making.</p>
            <p><strong>Other Development Works</strong><br>
              In this project, my role was multifaceted, encompassing planning, designing, coding, and testing. I began by gathering requirements and planning the structure of the blog, ensuring it would meet the needs of its users. I then designed the user interface, focusing on creating a clean and modern look that enhances the user experience. Using HTML, I structured the content of the blog, while CSS was employed to style the elements and ensure a responsive design. JavaScript was used to add interactivity, such as a dark mode toggle, enhancing the overall functionality of the blog. Throughout the project, I conducted thorough testing to ensure the blog was fully functional and free of bugs. Finally, I deployed the blog, making it accessible to users and ready for updates as my programming journey continues. This project not only allowed me to apply my technical skills but also provided a platform to document and share my learning experiences with others.</p>
